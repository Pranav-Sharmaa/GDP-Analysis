<h1>GDP Analysis Project</h1>

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data of countries worldwide. The dataset contains information about the GDP of various countries over a period of time, allowing for comprehensive analysis and insights into global economic trends.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of GDP data for all countries across the world. It includes variables such as country name, GDP value, and possibly additional features such as GDP growth rate, GDP per capita, and year.

## Goals
- Explore and visualize the GDP trends of different countries.
- Identify countries with the highest and lowest GDP.
- Analyze the correlation between GDP and other socio-economic factors.
- Investigate the impact of external factors (e.g., economic policies, natural disasters) on GDP growth.
- Compare the GDP growth rates of different regions or groups of countries (e.g., developed vs. developing nations).

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Plotly

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and format data types if necessary.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform descriptive statistics, visualize GDP trends using Plotly for interactive visualizations.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Conduct statistical tests to explore relationships between GDP and other variables.
4. **Visualization**: Create informative visualizations using Plotly to present insights effectively. Note that Plotly may open the graph in a new tab for interactive exploration.
5. **Interpretation**: Interpret the results obtained from the analysis and draw conclusions.

## Files
- `gdp.csv`: Contains the raw GDP data.
- `GDP Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis and visualization.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Conclusion
GDP analysis is crucial for understanding the economic health of nations and global economic trends. By analyzing the provided dataset, this project aims to derive meaningful insights into the factors influencing GDP growth and the disparities in economic development among countries.
